Advent of Code 2023

Learning / improving Go.

To run:
- Save your input files under `data/` as `01.txt`, `02.txt`, etc
- `go run .` - run all
- `go run . <days>` - run one or more days. E.g. `go run . 2` or `go run . 1 3 15`

## DISCLAIMER
I do Advent of Code for fun. Solutions may be optimized for speed-to-solve, execution time, entertainment value, learning, or any/none of the above. Maintainability, readability, etc are not included - be warned ðŸ™‚
